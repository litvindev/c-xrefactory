# C-xrefactory - A refactoring tool for C and Emacs

Once apon a time there was [http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk), a
site promoting possibly the worlds first refactoring browser to cross
the ["Refactoring's
Rubicon"](http://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoringRubicon.html).

At that time it had a free Java and C version, and a paid C++
version. Development seems to have been headed by a [Mari치n
Vittek](http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/w/Marian_Vittek/en).

Mari치n have been hard to track down and
[http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk) seems to be going up and
(mostly) down and there has been no support for many years.

Mari치n made a C-version, c-xref, available under GPL already 2009 on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/) which is
limited to C and Emacs.

As I'm almost dependent on this and refactoring tools for C is sadly
lacking, I decided to pick this up and work a bit on it, maybe even
make it a [bit more visible](http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/),
by moving it to GitHub. Although C-xref seems to be a crippled,
quickly, thrown together, version of the full C/Java browser, I've
started from that. No-one would be more happy than me if the original C
and Java version, or better still, the C++ version, where added here
or made publicly available somewhere.

If someone has contact with Mari치n, please inform him and ask him to
contact me. Perhaps we can create something great from this together
with others who might be interested.
